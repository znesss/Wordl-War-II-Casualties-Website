# World-War-II-Casualties-Website

A website with JavaScript, HTML, css, and D3 that uses the methods of Data Visualisation for demonstrating the casualties and the details inferred from the dataset of WW II

The boilerplate code ships with D3 V4. 

If you want to use a more recent version (latest is D3 V6.2), please change the script references inside index.html and modify the syntax of possible D3 commands that have changed in the new version. Please refer to D3 documentation page for release notes.

Remember, to be able to access the data files with javascript, you will need to be serving the correct Directory, not just opening the HTML file in a browser. If your development environment doesn't already launch a server for you, you can start one with:

cd path/to/WWII

# python 2

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# python 3

python3 -m http.server


And you can view the page at http://localhost:8080
